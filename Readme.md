# Student Course Registration System, DBMS,2019
Database Assignment,
You can use everything, just don't copy the Names and stuff.

#### Objective
We are supposed to build a Student Course Registration System for the University. We should be using the ***lamp stack*** and ***php*** for this purpose.
According to our plans , we implemented the following features in the system, 
1. ***A Student panel :***
  * The Student can log in to the system using the enrollment number and password provided to him by the administration during admission.
  * He can register for new courses and see the data that he submitted and make proper changes to it if there are any errors.
  ***An Admin Panel:***
  * To view the data submitted data provided by the students.
  * To Make Proper Changes to the student data, edit or delete a student.
  * To add students
  * To add a course and department.
  * Make changes to the current courses (edit or delete them).

#### Results
  * We implemented the system using ***php*** and wrote commands to query the SQL database.

He can :

This is the panel used by the administrators of the database.
They log in using the password given to them.We consider that the admin details has already been included in the database.

    There are further improvements to be done, such as improving the layout, adding an option to view the list of students opting for a particular course. Also, we have to make sure that there is less redundancy in the data as possible.
    We have to add additional security features to avoid SQL Injection and other harmful attacks on the database.
